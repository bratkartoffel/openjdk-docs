# prebuilt OpenJDK docs for alpine aports

The docs require pandoc to build and are available just on a few archs. In order to provide openjdk for more archs, the docs are prebuilt and uploaded to github. The built downloads them from here and repackages them as proper apk files.

See [this MR](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/merge_requests/81985) for details
